# THM_Writups
Here are my writeups from Try Hack Me. In the writeups I give some some security recommendations but not all. For example: I don't give the recommendation the disable HTTP and force the use of HTTPS. Doing so makes the writeups more readable.

Writeups:
1. Basic Pentesting (lin)
2. Pickle Rick (lin)
3. Zeno (lin)
4. Mr. Robot (lin)
5. kiba (lin)
6. Rootme (lin)
