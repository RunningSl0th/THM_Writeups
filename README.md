# THM_Writups
Here are my writeups from Try Hack Me. In the writeups I give some some security recommendations but not all. For example: I don't give the recommendation the disable HTTP and force the use of HTTPS. Doing so makes the writeups more readable.

Writeups:
1. Basic Pentesting
2. Pickle Rick
3. Zeno
4. Mr. Robot
5. kiba

6.
